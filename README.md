# The Movie DB - Technical test

## Introduction

This project was built for a technical test for Fleet. I had to build a simple movie browsing app in React, one using a JSON file as a database, and another using The Movie Database API. I built one app with two different pages, one for each version.

Components required: a list of the movies, a search bar, details about a specific movie.
